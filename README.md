### What I learned

Phew, it wa really exciting to finally put my hands on some code and complete this challenge. I tried to maybe do a little above what wa shown in the design tho. Lol...I wanted to try out some animation/keyframes which I learnt recently and also add some kindda interactivity on the site.

It's my first time writing this, I'm sure I'll get better with time. But for now, I'm just excited to share my solution. I especially enjoyed trying to make it as pixel-perfect as possible, coming from a Graphic Design background, it was really fun to see that lines of code could instruct the computer to do something so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing!
